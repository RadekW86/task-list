# Tasks List

## DEMO:
https://radekw86.github.io/tasks-list/

This app allows user to create an ad-hoc tasks list, mark tasks done and remove tasks from the list. The operation is performed via functional buttons and a form.
The js script behind uses a table of objects and short arrow functions to provide the functionality.
