# Tasks List

## DEMO:
https://radekw86.github.io/task-list/

This app allows user to create an ad-hoc task list, mark tasks done/undone and remove tasks from the list. The operation is performed via functional buttons and a form.
The js script behind uses a table of objects and short arrow functions to provide the functionality.
